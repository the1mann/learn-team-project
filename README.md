# The Team Project

Now its time to get stuck into a complex team project. This will cover the majority of Term 2. By the end of this you 
should have a good experience of what it is like to develop in a small team, learning best practises of project
management and source control with Git.
_____

## Form a Team
The first thing you need to do! Your team should have 3 - 4 members. I may put any extra people at random into your
group. Don't know them? This will be part of the challenge.

## Define Project Goals / Deliverables
Once your team is approved you'll need decide on a project and what you aim to deliver. Make sure that your team is
willing to commit enough time to deliver them!

## Plan Your Project
#### 1. Organise available time with the team
Make sure that you all first know how much time everyone is willing to put in. This will affect what you can deliver.

#### 2. Create a Slack channel for your team
Make sure you set up a default method of communication as soon as you can. If you want to build anything to be proud
of **you need to communicate well**.

#### 3. Discuss team strengths & weaknesses
Get to know your team, what they're good at and what they suck at.

#### 4. Define Project Goals / Deliverables
Now the fun part. Pick a project that you'd like to do. Once you've done that then work on the specific tasks that
you could deliver/complete. *Then pick which ones your team will have enough time to do*.

#### 5. Designate a Scrum Master
This person will be responsible for facilitating planning, and reminding your team about progress and asking what
everyone on the team has accomplished. Pick wisely.

#### 6. Write out backlog
Take those tasks you will deliver and then break them down to user stories/features. Each one should cover a particular 
action a user may do. You should have 3 - 10 of these. Sort these then in priority. Most important items should be done
first.

#### 7. Plan your first sprint
Add what tasks you'd like to see done in the first sprint (two weeks). Then break down theses tasks into smaller tasks.
Now you can all start working!

#### 8. Create your shared repository
Create a repo on Github, and commit to it regularly. My advice is to work on each task in different branches, and merge them
only once they are complete and reviewed by someone else in the team.


## Due Date
The end date of this project is the *27th June at 1pm*. Each team will have *20 minutes* to present (yes we will go overtime) 
and be expected to provide a final presentation of their product.

## Other
Need a server? Website hosting? An Android Device? Domain? SSL? 
A sponsor may be able to provide it for you **free**. Just ask me as soon as you can.

## Project Options

### Adelaide Metro Real Time API
Your goal is to make an application to parse and display this information to users. It should show nearby transport stops,
its address and when the next vehicle is arriving.

**Resources:**
- [API Information](http://data.sa.gov.au/data/dataset/adelaide-metro-real-time-passenger-information)

### Cryptocurrency
Your goal is to create your own cryptocurrency, and a website to explain how the currency works and how to 'mine' some.
The website should be easy for anyone to understand how the currency works and how it differs from regular currency or 
online sources such as Paypal.
An optional extension is to create your own 'wallet app' for the cryptocurrency.
At the end of the project anyone should be able to complete a transaction.
Alternatively, if you have another project idea regarding cryptocurrency, make me a proposal.

### Fitness Gamification
Your goal is to create an application that encourages users both in the short term and long term to exercise more using 
achievements (eg. 'badges', 'medals', 'PSN trophies'). Using the Google Fit API (which can hook into multiple sources),
you will award users on activity such as "longest distance travelled in a week", daily goals, etc. How you think this
is achieved is up to your team.

- [Google Fit SDK](https://developers.google.com/fit/)
- [Gamification Tips & Types](https://badgeville.com/wiki/Game_Design)

### Lunchbox
Your goal is to build an app that will recommend only one restaurant nearby that your might want to go to, as soon as you
open the app. Only one place can be shown at a time, with options to like it or not. 
Ideally, the app will show dinner option if it is dinnertime, a lunch place if it is lunchtime.
You may wish to have user accounts, or not.

- [Google Places API](https://developers.google.com/places/)

### Google Cardboard
Your goal is to create an application or game that uses Google Cardboard and a number of VR specific gestures.
Kits will be provided if you choose this option.

- [Google Cardboard SDK](https://developers.google.com/cardboard/overview)
- [Designing for Google Cardboard](http://www.google.com/design/spec-vr/designing-for-google-cardboard/a-new-dimension.html)

### ..Or Whatever?
All the above don't quite fit? Got something better? Make me a proposal!
